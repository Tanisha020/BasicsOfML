# Question - 0
# create a variable called color with an appropriate value on the line below
color = 'blue'

# Question - 1
pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3
# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter/2
# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * radius ** 2

# Question - 2
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]
# Your code goes here. Swap the values to which a and b refer.
a,b = b,a

# Question - 3(a)
# Add parentheses to the following expression so that it evaluates to 1.
(5 - 3) // 2
# Question - 3(b)
# Add parentheses to the following expression so that it evaluates to 0.
(8 - 3) * (2 - (1 + 1))

# Question - 4
# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and carol
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77
carol_candies = 109
# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies
to_smash = (alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies) % 3
